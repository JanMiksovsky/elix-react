This repo contains demos of Elix components used in React applications.

# Install

Since this repo currently uses a branch of the main elix/elix repo, you need to
install things with npm instead of Yarn.

1. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`

You should then be able to open the demo HTML files.

At the moment, these demos do not work with the polyfills, and require native
Shadow DOM and Custom Elements support.
